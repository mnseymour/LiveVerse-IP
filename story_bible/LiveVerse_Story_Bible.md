# LiveVerse Story Bible (v0.1)

## 1. High Concept  
Cosmic rifts deliver hybrid beings to Earth. Kids use NFC BeatCards to guide their fates—hero or villain.

## 2. The Rift Timeline  
• Pre-Rift – Elven Memory Trees guard time  
• Rift Arrival – Cloud falls from the breach  
• Season One – Alignment flips begin

## 3. Key Factions  
• Luminarch Sentinels  
• Foundry Syndicate  
• Neo-Orbitals  
• Riftborn Rogues

## 4. Keystone: Cloud  
Hybrid Saiyan-Anunnaki-Elf. Raised by Elves. Time-Veil cloak. Hero/Villain duality.

## 5. Tech Lore  
LiveVerse toys use BLE Mesh, NFC BeatCards, and Mag-Dock rails. Every move is parent-safe, never rogue.
